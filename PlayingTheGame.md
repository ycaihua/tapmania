# Main menu #
In the main menu you can select a couple of items. The item you are really interested in is called "Play TapMania".

# Song selection #
You get a song "wheel" which you can roll like any other on the iPhone. The song selected ATM is the one which is highlighted (Dooooh). To start the song you MUST DOUBLE TAP the selected song (in the frame, e.g. highlighted).

# Modifiers #
In the song selection screen you can see two modifiers on the top of the screen, namely the difficulty level and the speed mod. They are both touchable. You can touch it to change the value. NOTE that some songs does support only one difficulty so you will not be able to change it then.

Have fun :)
