**Why is my song not working?**
_-Have you checked whether it's in DWI format and the music is MP3? if not - check. If MP3 and DWI then you can send me an email or file a bug._

**Where can I get new songs?**
_-Tapmania supports StepMania files (mostly). So the good places to search for new songs are the same as for stepmania.. good "keyboard" files can be found on http://stepmaniaonline.com__

**Why is OGG not supported?**
_-Because iPhone OS lacks support for it and it's pretty hard to get working. However I'm trying to get it working so stay tuned._

More to come.. Happy tapping :P
