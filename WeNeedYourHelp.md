Hi everyone,

TapMania needs your support.

If you can code Obj-C for iPhone or you are a decent designer you are welcome to join the project and make the dream come true!
Testers are also very welcome. Everyone who plays the game and find bugs is asked to file them using the **Issues** tab here. It's open for everyone.

You can also contact me directly on godexsoft /at/ gmail [dot](dot.md) com.
**Please don't use comments on wiki pages for bug reports and questions**.. I might miss these completely since I'm pretty much busy all the time..

Thanks a lot for your help :-)
Together we are strong!

Alex
