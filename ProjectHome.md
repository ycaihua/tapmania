This project aims to create a DDR/ITG simulator for the iPhone/iPod touch.
TapMania uses the formats used by StepMania (currently .dwi and .sm) so that you can play almost all your favorite songs right on your handheld.

CURRENT RELEASE: **0.2.1** is available on the AppStore!

Visit our community portal at http://tapmania.org

Total TapMania gamers count is currently around 100,000+ people around the world.

TapMania has support for Themes and Noteskins! You can grab them in Cydia under the App addons category!

Ogg is enabled in 0.1.6 version however it's working on the CPU and thus will hardly be usable for people with slower CPU. Probably would be fine for iPhone 3GS and maybe even iTouch 2G. in 0.1.7-0.1.8 the sound engine is slightly rewritten so OGG might not even try to play.

**On 0.2.1 and newer - OGG is completely disabled.**

Why .OGG was not supported at all and why it will work slow/bad for most of us - Read WhyNoOgg manual page.
